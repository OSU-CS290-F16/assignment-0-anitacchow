		<p> <b>On a scale from 0 to 10, how well do you know HTML? </b> </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px">Solid 4 without internet access probably a 7 or 8 if I'm allowed to lookup things. I have a pretty poor memory so I rely more that I would like on code examples and old code </p>				
		<p> <b>What do you hope to learn from this class? </b> </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px">I'm not quite sure at this point. A refresher on webpage mechanics and learning some new tricks would be nice. </p>
		<p> <b>Have you signed up for Piazza? </b> </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Yes </p>
		<p> <b>Most interesting experience or fact about you? </b> </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> I've never broken a bone and I seriously dislike these type of questions. I never know what to put for these open ended questions so that's my answer. </p>
