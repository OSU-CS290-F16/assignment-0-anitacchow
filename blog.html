		<p style="margin-left: 50px"> <b>Challenges doing the assignment and how I solved them?</b> I didn't remember how to indent an html document without using css to define tabs, so I looked it up and found that you just use margin-left and set a number of pixels and immediate indent. The downfall being I have to type that entire thing everytime I wanted to indent lines </p>
		<p style ="margin-left:50px"> <b>Things learned from the assignment?</b> I forgot how to include things in a pure html document so looking up help documents on the correct syntax for everything (shout out to w3schools.com for including pretty much everything I needed in a nice and succinct style). </p> 
		<p style ="margin-left:50px"> <b>Helpful resources?</b> Piazza was helpful because I got the error where I wasn't able to accept assignment 0 and I was just about to write an email to the TAs/Professors when I saw that someone posted having the same issue and that to just keep trying to accept the assignement and eventually it would work. Fixed my problem, so success the system works! </p>
